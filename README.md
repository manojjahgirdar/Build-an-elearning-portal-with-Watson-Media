# Build an e-learning portal with Watson Media.

The COVID pandemic has altered our conventional ways of working in companies, startups, businesses, and Educational Institutes were no different. In the current times, to maintain social distancing, Schools and Colleges are choosing the e-learning platforms to impart education. Though, it started as a  precautionary measure to stop the further spread of the pandemic. But it is turning into a much more effective and efficient mode of teaching in terms of resources. More and more startups are emerging in the educational domain to make use of this window of opportunity.  Therefore, IBM brings forth `IBM Watson Media` to the developer community, which provides almost everything they need to build an e-learning platform for their startup. 

[IBM Watson Media](https://www.ibm.com/watson/media) offers AI-driven solutions for live streaming events, corporate communication, video analytics, and content management. This Comprehensive video streaming platform provides Live stream and auto-archive for video-on-demand viewing to boost overall reach and engagement. Use IBM Watson Media solutions to stream events, executive town halls, video marketing product launches, and entertainment OTT (over-the-top) streaming. Built for scale and reliability, to optimize video quality, and powered by IBM Watson AI for video search and automated closed captioning, our video solutions are used by thousands of enterprises, service providers, educators, and media companies worldwide to improve video workflows, reliability and content monetization.

In this code pattern, we will demonstrate how to quickly build an `e-learning portal` using `Watson Media`.

The Scope of this Code Pattern is limited to following capabilities. `However, the Solutions can be scaled to accomodate a lot more functionalities andd capabilities through the Services, Products, Solutions and APIs provided by Watson Media.`  

- Create channels for different areas of learning. 
- Create and upload videos for a channel.
- Password restrict the access to videos.
- Restrict domains where the video can be embedded.
- Build a web application with authentication to access the channels using the APIs provided by Watson Media. 

### Flow

![architecture](doc/src/images/architecture.png)

1. Admin requests to authorizes app in `/admin`
2. App redirects admin to IBM OAuth2.0 portal.
3. Node Server receives Auth token from Watson Media.
4. App requests server for the auth token
5. App uses auth token to create dashboard for user on runtime.
6. User logs in and accesses content.

### Included components

* [IBM Watson Media](https://www.ibm.com/watson/media): It offers AI-driven solutions for live streaming events, corporate communication, video analytics, and content management.
* [Kubernetes](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create): IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service creates a cluster of compute hosts and deploys highly available containers. A Kubernetes cluster lets you securely manage the resources that you need to quickly deploy, update, and scale applications.

### Featured technologies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): An asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, designed to build scalable applications
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): Javascript library for building User Interfaces
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker): Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

  <details><summary><b>Deploy Locally</b></summary>

  * After node modules have been installed run the following command 
  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```
  After this the application is listening on http://localhost:8080/

  * Open your Web Browser and visit http://localhost:8080 .You will be redirected to http://localhost:8080/admin . Here enter the Client ID that you previously copied. and click **Authorize.**
  ![admin_auth](doc/src/images/admin_auth.png)

  * This will redirect you to Watson Media OAuth and you will be required to login with your W3, UStream or Device Credentials. After logging in, click **Authorize.**
  ![admin_oauth](doc/src/images/admin_oauth.png)
  ![authorize](doc/src/images/authorize.png)

  * Successful Authentication will redirect you to http://localhost:8080/login . 
  Here the user is required to enter the login credentials managed by the developer. For demonstration we are using the credentials stored in `React UI/src/content/sampleLogin.json`.
  Look them up and enter it in the text boxes on `/login` and click Login.
  ![login](doc/src/images/login.png)

  #### Create a free Kubernetes Cluster on IBM Cloud

  * Create a free Kubernetes Cluster Account on https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create
  ![kubernetes](doc/src/images/kubernetes.png)

  * Connect your terminal to IBM Cloud using the following commands
  ![kubernetes steps](doc/src/images/cloud_steps.png)

  * Click on worker nodes in the left navigation bar and copy your public IP.
  ![workernodes](doc/src/images/worker_nodes.png)



  #### Build and push Docker Image to Docker Hub.
  * Inside the directory `watson-media-node` run the following command
  ```bash
  docker build -t <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG> .
  ```

  The command should look like this
  ```bash
  docker build -t randomUser/watson-media-node:v2 .
  ```

  * After docker image is built, push it to docker hub using the following command
  ```bash
  docker push <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG> 
  ```

  * Inside the directory `watson-media-node`, change `deploy.yaml` file replace line no. 17 to
  ```bash
  image : <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG>
  ```
  It should look something like this 
  ```bash
  image: randomUser/watson-node-elearning:v2
  ```

  #### Deploy on Kubernetes

  * Next run the following command to deploy the image to kubernetes.
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
  ```
  The Application is now running on your kubernetes node.

  * Go to your Watson Media API/SDK Access Dashboard and change the Redirect URL to http://<YOUR_KUBERNETES_NODE_PUBLIC_IP>:32423/get_token
